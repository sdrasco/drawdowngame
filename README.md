*A retro market simulator.*  

---

**Drawdown** is a deliberately lean simulation of stock market decision-making, a modern tribute to [*Millionaire: The Stock Market Simulation*, created by Jim Zuber and published by Blue Chip Software in 1982](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millionaire:_The_Stock_Market_Simulation).  Hopefully it will make you feel smart, rich, and wrong —  all at once.
