*A retro market simulator.*  

---

**Drawdown** is a deliberately lean simulation of stock market decision-making, a modern tribute to [*Millionaire: The Stock Market Simulation*, created by Jim Zuber and published by Blue Chip Software in 1982](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millionaire:_The_Stock_Market_Simulation).

## Gameplay Overview

| **Phase**              | **What Happens** |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Start Game**         | Choose new or resume; you start with $35k, a "Novice" badge and a few weeks of history. |
| **Weekly Loop (up to 104)** | |
| • Index Update         | The market chart gets another data point. |
| • Headlines            | About ten news blurbs hint at coming moves. |
| • Trade                | Check Analysis, peek at your Portfolio, then buy or sell a few shares. |
| • Advance Week         | Commit your trades. Prices jump and your rank might improve. |
| **Retire**             | Cash out any time—or after week 104—and join the high score list. |

### Portfolio Stats

The in-game portfolio will eventually display standard trading performance
metrics, including:

- **Max drawdown (%):** the largest peak-to-trough decline in net worth.
- **Sharpe ratio:** average return divided by the standard deviation of
  returns.
- **Gain to Pain ratio:** total return divided by the absolute value of all
  negative returns.
